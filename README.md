# Perovskites_visualization
This is part of a project on studying structure electronic properties of a specific perovskite surface. This repo is only for visualizing DOS and band structure of bulk structures. For more details see our publication (upcoming) 
All the *.dat files are named for readability. Example: cubicBAND.dat contains cubic perovskite bandstructure. 
You will need the following packages:
1)Numpy
2)Matplotlib

There are two python scripts. plotBAND.py plots the bandstructure for cubic/orthorhombic unit cell. Modify as needed. plotDOS.py plots the partial density of states for the perovskite bulk&surface. Modify as needed.
